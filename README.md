## Abstract
The proposed solution focuses on the academic advising process by creating an assistant system for academic advisors and students. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive dashboard that presents a fine-grained visual representation of the essential information and data needed by the advisor in one place. The solution is designed to significantly reduce the workload and time spent on manual data collection and analysis by bringing all relevant information into one central location.
## Motiviation
The increasing number of college students had significantly contributed to the increasing workload on the academic advisor. The demand for one platform to gather all students' data in one place from the academic advising point of view. This can be achieved by providing some assisting information through student's profile to review, progress to check, and important decisions regarding the student progress. Eventually, academic advisors should struggle less when gathering all the necessary information to understand each student's profile.
